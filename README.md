# String Permutation

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This script takes a word or a string of character that is given by the user and creates every possible permutation   
out of that word/string                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                         
## Requirements

* `python 3.5` - `3.7`                                                                                                        
* `colorama` via pip
  * Only required on Windows 
* `tqdm` via pip
  * Optional, but highly recommended as the built in functions slows the program drastically
