## Docs

While this isn't a huge project, there are a few things that might need explaining and would be good to know. [Click here](https://github.com/StrangeRanger/string-permutation/wiki) to better understand how the program works.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* `python 3.5` - `3.8`
* `colorama`
  * Only required on Windows
* `tqdm`
  * Optional, but highly recommended as the built in functions slows the program drastically
